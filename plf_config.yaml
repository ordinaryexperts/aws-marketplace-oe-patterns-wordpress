"Full Description": "The Ordinary Experts WordPress Pattern is an open-source AWS CloudFormation template that offers an easy-to-install AWS infrastructure solution for quickly deploying a WordPress website, using both AWS and WordPress best practices.

Automatically configured to support auto-scaling through AWS Auto Scaling Groups, this solution leverages an EFS file system to share user generated content and application files between application servers, and SES for sending emails.

The template ensures multi-level security by incorporating AWS IAM for federated access to resources with least privilege and AWS managed keys and Secret Manager to manage secrets for encryption of data at rest and in transit.

We support multiple availability zones using an RDS Aurora MySQL cluster and EC2 Auto Scaling Groups."

All information gathered by the WordPress application is stored either on encrypted EFS volumes or in its encrypted Aurora database. To monitor for the health of the application, check the ALB Health Dashboard. Several IAM resources are provisioned as part of this product: SesInstanceUser IAM user - used to generate an Access Key (SesInstanceUserAccessKey) for SMTP email sending via SES. SesGenerateSMTPPasswordLambdaRole IAM role - used by Lambda to generate SMTP password based on InstanceUserAccessKey and store in Secrets Manager. AsgInstanceRole IAM role - attached to EC2 instance and allows for sending logs to CloudWatch as well as accessing Secrets Manager and Parameter Store. SesInstanceUserCreateSecretPolicy IAM policy - used by lambda function for generating SMTP password from SesInstanceUserAccessKey. For network configuration, please reference the architecture diagram. For a pricing breakdown, please reference the AWS Calculator link. For more detailed instructions, see the GitHub project."
